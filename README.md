# I-Severini

This is our project for the cotest "GameAbility 2023" for which it was required to create a videogame that makes coexist neurodegenerative diseases such as ASL (amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis) or ML (multiple Sclerosis), art and game.
As an expression of art we decided to use the medium of music, inviting the user to play with the only use of the feet on a virtual keyboard projected on the ground.
We used python, javascript, html, css, npm and for each of them dedicated libraries:
- python: mediapipe, opencv and websockets.sync.client 
-  javascript:  jquery, bootstrap and ion-icon
- npm: ws, fs, child_process
